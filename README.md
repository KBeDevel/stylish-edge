Stylish - a user style manager for Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.

## IMPORTANT

On December 2018, Microsoft decided to convert the current MS Edge to a Chromium-based browser. For this reason, this repo is being deprecated, so if you want to use Stylish on the new Edge, please visit the <a href="https://www.userstyles.org/" target="_blank">official website</a> for more info.
